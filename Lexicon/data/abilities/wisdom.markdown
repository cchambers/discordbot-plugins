__**Wisdom**__

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

**Wisdom**

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

**Other Wisdom Checks**

The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

• Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
• Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

**Spellcasting Ability**

Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

***Finding a Hidden Object***

When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.

In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success.

For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. 

If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.
