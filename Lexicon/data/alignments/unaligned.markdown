__**Unaligned**__

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments â€” they are unaligned.

Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. 

Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.
