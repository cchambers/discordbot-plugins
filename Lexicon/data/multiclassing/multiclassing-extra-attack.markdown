__**Multiclassing - Extra Attack**__

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together.

You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does).

Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.
