__**Multiclassing - Channel Divinity**__

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesnâ€™t give you an additional use of it.

You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you.

For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses.

Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.
