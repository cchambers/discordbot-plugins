__**Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling**__

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.

At the DM â€™s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. 

Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
